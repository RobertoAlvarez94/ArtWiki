                        Over the last years were AI has been creeping up in social media and becoming available for the public, an issue has been brewing up: GenAI.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        YES! GenAI has been trained with thousands of art pieces from marvellous artis around the World Wide Web. Personally, I see this as a problem because I used to enjoy art on Instagram, Twitter and other social media platforms which I use to love. Now we have that AI slop overflowing even the conventions where I used to go and buy some nice art work and stickers. So I decided to grab a pencil and some paper and doodled away.

                    <p>
                        I started learning to draw about 2 or 3 years ago and felt lost on where to begin and I joined some art communities and they passed me down their knowledge and I wanted to give back to the community.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I am a programmer by profession and a watercolor artist by hobby and I intend on using my understanding to give art back to you.
